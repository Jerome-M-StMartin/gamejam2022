To any who may be reading this:

My name is Wesley Smasher.

As a self-proclaimed explorer, I rode my jetski out from the coast of Dukat Island. I’d estimate my distance from any land to be approximately 150 miles, exactly one tank of gas on the NCC-1701-D. I paddled to a nearby pad of earth to assess the situation. Luckily, I carry my divorce papers wherever I go and can thus use them as a vellum to write for help. I would appreciate any assistance you can send me, but would prefer any rescue boat to be no less than 50 feet long and include a device for which I can check my finances. 

Sincerely,

Mr. Smasher

As per my last letter, my name is Mr. Wesley Smasher and I have found myself on an island that is only a mere square kilometer in area near Dukat Island. It has been one day since I beached my jetski, but as I was fashioning myself a palm leaf blanket, a wave carried it away. My last companion on this earth. At least the birds here seem to like me. If only they could bring me the latest copy of the New York Times. 

I have been quenching myself with the fruits of the island– coconuts, mostly. I did try to avoid the coconut water fad for the last few years, but alas, the Smashers do what they must. Again, I must ask for help. Please send help.

Thanks,

Mr. Smasher

Once again, my name is Wesley Smasher: yes, the same one from the many missing persons reports I imagine have been filed in my absence. I fear I have ingested the last of the island’s meager crop. Soon, I shall have to resort to eating the small shelled creatures on the shore. I wonder if this is how Anne Frank felt– trapped somewhere and unable to escape, jet ski nowhere to be found.

May these letters gain me the same notability Ms. Frank received.

Best,

Mr. Smasher

I must say, I have not been this hungry since 1998 when my now-ex-wife Barbara went on a ‘girls trip.’ I didn’t eat for two nights as she traipsed through town with her ill-behaved friends. That was the last foray she was allowed. Perhaps if I let her see her parents for Christmas three years ago she would not have bought me the NCC-1701-D for my birthday and I would not be in this situation. 
As with all problems in my life up to this point, my presence here originates from Barbara. I do hope she realizes her mistake and sends someone to find me, for there exists no further water which I may drink.

Regards, 

Mr. Smasher

this is it… the last page of my divorce papers… i tried eating sand… the grains stuck in my teeth… nothing like caviar…


if you ever find it, I bequeath my precious NCC-1701-D to my ex-wife Barbara… so that she may hopefully rot on this island like i have…


i have cried my last tear.
